## Architecture and UML

The project is structured in multiple layers:

- **Presentation Layer:**
  - **Desktop Application:** Developed using Windows Forms for staff operations.
  - **Web Application:** Built using ASP.NET Core to handle customer interactions.
  
- **Business Logic Layer:**
  - Contains managers and controllers (e.g., `OrderManager`, `ItemManager`, `UserManager`, `CategoryManager`, `BonusCardManager`, etc.) that implement the core functionality and business rules.
  
- **Data Access Layer:**
  - Responsible for database interactions using MySQL.
  - Classes such as `DBUser`, `DBOrder`, `DBItem`, and `DBCategory` provide CRUD operations and other data manipulation functionalities.
  
- **UML Design:**
  - The UML diagram details the classes, interfaces, enumerations, and their relationships (associations, generalizations, and realizations). It provides a clear overview of the systemâ€™s structure.
  - For a detailed view of the UML design, please refer to the project documentation or the UML diagram file included in the repository.
